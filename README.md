# GO!
Yes it’s time to white-board, to code, to troubleshoot bugs, to re-code, to solve other bugs, to refactor, etc..

Development is not a long quiet river, but it can be really fun!

Starting today, you are building YOUR project - be proud of it!

# Evaluation - Show off!
After the pitch, now you will code - nice right? but don’t forget you will present it at the end (the Peer Learning Day following this project) in front of professionals and staff.

Have fun!
